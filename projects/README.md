#### Island sensitivity of gap-filler dependencies as exemplified by double-gap relative clauses (RCs) in Japanese

<details>
  
  * I ran a couple of factorial-design acceptability experiments in order to examine whether the dependency where a gap precedes its filler would exhibit the same degree of island effects as filler-gap dependencies, focusing on the case in Japanese where relativization seems to have taken place out of another RC.
  * Presentation slides for a talk on this project can be accessed [here](CAMP_Takahashi.pdf)

#### Presuppositional component of 'only' and the effect of experimental manipulations on its interpretation
<!---<span style="color:purple">*\#semantics&pragmatics*</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy">*\#English*</span> \--->
&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="only_presupposition.png" alt="only_presupposition" width="330"/>
<details>
  
  * I conducted a series of experiments to find out what is presupposed by the focus marker 'only'; is it the prejacent of the sentence (e.g., "John ate only bananas" presupposes that "John ate (at least) bananas"), or something else? My focus is on whether a certain experimental paradigm, namely the one that proffers alternative propositions in the form of response options, can change the presuppositional component of 'only'.

#### Scalar implicature in online experiments
<!---<span style="color:purple">*\#semantics&pragmatics*</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:navy">*\#English*</span>--->

<details>
  
  * I am conducting some experiments to discover the effects of modality, as well as the presence of an in-person experimenter, on the way participants engage in pragmatic reasoning, with a focus on the well-known "some-but-not-all" implicature.
