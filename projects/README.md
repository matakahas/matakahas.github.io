## Ongoing projects:

*	Island sensitivity of gap-filler dependencies as exemplified by double-gap relative clauses in Japanese
    - I ran a couple of factorial-design acceptability experiments in order to examine whether a rightward head raising out of a relative clause in Japanese, which exemplifies a gap-filler dependency, is a case of island violation.
*	Presuppositional component of 'only' and contextual manipulation to affect its interpretation
    - I am conducting a series of experiments to find out what is presupposed by the word 'only'; is it the prejacent of the sentence (e.g., "John ate only bananas" presupposes that "John ate (at least) bananas"), or something else?
    - Data analysis forthcoming 
*	English-speaking children's interpretation of plural definite descriptions (paused due to the inability to run experiments on-site)

## Past projects:
*	English-speaking children's acquisition of passive structures (write-up available [here](http://www.lingref.com/bucld/42/BUCLD42-16.pdf))
*	Japanese-speaking children's acquisition of the syntactic constraints on floating quantifiers (write-up available [here](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/58832/RN55-LLL2017.pdf))
*	Examination of verb restructuring in purpose clause and gerundive clause in Japanese (write-up available [here](http://www.waseda.jp/assoc-JATLaC/Journals/Resources/01.Takahashi.pdf))
