## Ongoing projects:

*	Island sensitivity of gap-filler dependencies as exemplified by double-gap relative clauses (RCs) in Japanese
    - I ran a couple of factorial-design acceptability experiments in order to examine whether the dependency where a gap precedes its filler would exhibit the same degree of island effects as filler-gap dependencies, focusing on the case in Japanese where relativization seems to have taken place out of another RC.
    - Presentation slides for a talk on this project can be accessed [here](CAMP_Takahashi.pdf)
*	Presuppositional component of 'only' and the effect of experimental manipulations on its interpretation
    - I am conducting a series of experiments to find out what is presupposed by the word 'only'; is it the prejacent of the sentence (e.g., "John ate only bananas" presupposes that "John ate (at least) bananas"), or something else? I am also trying to find out whether the way ask people's intuition about word meaning in an experiment could influence their interpretation of certain words, including their presuppositional component.
*   Scalar implicature in online experiments
    - I am planning some experiments to discover the effects of modality, as well as the presence of an in-person experimenter, on the way participants engage in pragmatic reasoning, with a focus on the "some-but-not-all" implicature.
