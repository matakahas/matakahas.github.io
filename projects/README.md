  * For my dissertation project, I have run a series of factorial-design acceptability experiments to examine (i) whether relativization out of a relative clause island (double relative) in Japanese exhibits an island effect, and (ii) which factors modulate the size of the relative clause island effect in English and Japanese.
  * Results presented in multiple conferences (CUNY 34, CAMP 4, CLS 58, HSP 36).

#### Presupposition of 'only'

  * I conducted multiple experiments to find out what is presupposed by English focus marker 'only'; is it the prejacent of the sentence (e.g., "John ate only bananas" presupposes that "John ate (at least) bananas"), or something else? My focus is on whether a certain experimental paradigm, namely the one that proffers alternative propositions in the form of response options, can change the presuppositional component of 'only'.
  * Presented at AMLaP 2021 ([slides](AMLaP_Takahashi.pdf))

#### Scalar implicature in online experiments

&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="online_implicature.png" alt="online_implicature" width="300"/>
<details>
  
  * I examined the effect of presentation modality (video/picture/text), as well as the presence of an in-person experimenter, on the way participants engage in pragmatic reasoning, with a focus on the well-known "some-but-not-all" implicature.
  * Presented at 2022 Experiments in Linguistic Meaning ([slides](ELM_Takahashi.pdf))

#### computational modelling of island constraints in Japanese
&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="RC_attachment.png" alt="RC_attachment" width="300"/>
<details>
  
  * I evaluated neural language models like LSTM and GPT-2 to find out if they are capable of capturing grammatical constraints like islands in Japanese. 
  * Findings presented at SCiL 6 ([link to proceedings](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/scil/vol6/iss1/33/))
