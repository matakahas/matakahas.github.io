## How to apply Helmert coding
In working with data with a categorical variable (e.g., a factor with three levels: A, B, C), a regression model treats one level of the variable as the reference level (usually what comes up first alphabetically, so A), and compares that level with all the other levels; A vs B and A vs C. 

But what if we want to compare non-reference levels, like B vs C? Contrast coding makes this possible, including Helmert coding which I will demonstrate how to do here. 

Below is the sample data. `extraction_domain` column has three levels (baseline, existential, transitive), and let's say we want to compare mean acceptability of two non-baseline levels (existential, transitive).

```
##   subject_id extraction_domain acceptability
## 1          1          baseline    0.52157849
## 2          2          baseline   -0.04169323
## 3          3          baseline   -0.39919983
## 4          4          baseline    0.70724171
## 5          5          baseline    1.08893772
## 6          6          baseline    1.01628361
```


```r
levels(fake_data$extraction_domain)
```

```
## [1] "baseline"    "existential" "transitive"
```

By applying Helmert coding, we get to compare each level of a categorical variable to the mean of subsequent levels of the variable. So for our data, comparison goes as follows: A vs B+C, and B vs C (which is what we want to do). 

While R has `contr.helmert(n)` function (with n the number of levels in your variable), it applies the reverse Helmert coding, which lets us compare each level of a categorical variable to the mean of **previous** levels of the variable. Since that's not what we want to do, I will apply Helmert coding by creating a matrix with K-1 columns (for a variable with K levels), and applying the matrix to the dataset with `contrasts` function.


```r
my_helmert_ext_domain = matrix(c(2, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1), ncol = 2)
contrasts(fake_data$extraction_domain) = my_helmert_ext_domain
```

And here's what a linear mixed-effects model looks like after applying Helmert coding.

```r
my_model = lmer(acceptability~extraction_domain + (1 | subject_id), data = fake_data)
```

```
## boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')
```

```r
summary(my_model)
```

```

```

Under the "Fixed effects" section, you can see the results of two comparisons: "extraction_domain1" which is comparing the baseline with the mean of existential and transitive (significant), and "extraction_domain2" which is comparing existential and transitive (also significant).
