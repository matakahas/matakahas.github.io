## How to remove variables
At the end of a long script, you might want to remove any temporary variables/variables that you won't use. Here's how you do so:


```r
a = c(3,4,5)
b = c(6,7,8)
c = a+b

rm(list = setdiff(ls(), c("c")))
```

Now your environment only has the variable `c`. If you want to remove all variables from the environment, here's how:


```r
rm(list=ls())
```

Now your environment should be empty.
